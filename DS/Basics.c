/*
Storing data in a systamatic way is Data Structures.
There are 2 types - 
1. Linear DS -> Stacks & Queues
2. Non-Linear DS 

Linear DS - Data searched in any particular order or particular manner.
Linear DS: FIFO (Queue) | LIFO (Stack)

1. FIFO (First In First Out) also known as Queue:
The data strored in first in the queue (First In) will be come out first (First Out).

2. LIFO (Last In First Out) also know as Stack.
The data stored in last (Last In) will come out first (First Out).

When to perform LDS?
To perform operation on the data, without missing any data.

Non-Linear DS: Retreiving some amount of data needed for operation randomly from the data set.
Non-Linear DS: Trees | Graph

1. Trees - works on heirarchy concept

2. Graph - works on closed cycle path.
