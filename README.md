Hey there,
This is my all the questions done in my learning phase of C language. These are all the basic questions and few good ones are there too. You can try it yourself also if you are learning/revising the basics.
few codes are written and attempted questions are there where you can see and learn. Predict the output is included to dry run the codes to check whether your basics are cleared or not.
In few of them there might be minor mistake to be found (but it is rare) and wherever required effeceint codes are also written in the files below the programs.
It will surely help you.
Happy Learning! :)
